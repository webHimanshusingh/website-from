Explanation<br>

HTML Structure: Defines the layout with sections for threads and posts. Each thread and its posts are wrapped in a div with a class of .thread.<br>

CSS Styling: Provides basic styles for the layout, including a flexbox layout for the main content area, and styles for lists and hover effects.<br>

JavaScript Interaction: Defines a function showPosts that displays the posts for a selected thread and hides others. The default thread is displayed when the page loads.<br>

This example can be expanded with more advanced features such as user authentication, dynamic content loading, and database integration for a fully functional forum.<br>
